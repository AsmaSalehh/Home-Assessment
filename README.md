# Analog Clock QML

This is a simple analog clock implemented in QML. It displays the current time and allows the user to adjust the hours and minutes using draggable handles.

## Usage

1. Run the QML code in a QML-compatible environment, such as Qt Creator or QML Viewer.

2. The clock hands will indicate the current time. The hour and minute handles can be dragged to adjust the time.

## Components

- `clock`: The main container for the clock components.
- `hourHand`: The rectangle representing the hour hand.
- `minuteHand`: The rectangle representing the minute hand.
- `secondHand`: The rectangle representing the second hand.
- `MouseArea`: Allows dragging the hour and minute hands to adjust the time.

## Dependencies

- Qt Quick 2.15
- Qt Quick Window 2.15

Note: The provided QML code does not use Qt Quick Controls. It solely relies on Qt Quick for creating the analog clock interface and implementing the draggable handles for adjusting the time.
